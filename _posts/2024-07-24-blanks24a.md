title: An Improved Bayesian Permutation Entropy Estimator with Wasserstein-Optimized
  Hierarchical Priors
abstract: 'We introduce a novel hierarchical Bayesian permutation entropy (PermEn)
  estimator designed to improve biomedical time series entropy assessments, especially
  for short signals. Unlike existing methods requiring a substantial number of observations
  or which impose restrictive priors, our non-centered, Wasserstein optimized hierarchical
  approach enables efficient MCMC inference and a broader range of PermEn priors.
  Evaluations on synthetic and secondary benchmark data demonstrate superior performance
  over the current state-of-the-art, including 13.33-63.67% lower estimation error,
  8.16-47.77% lower posterior variance, and 47-60.83% lower prior construction error
  ($p \leq 2.42 \times 10^{-10}$). Applied to cardiopulmonary exercise test oxygen
  uptake signals, we reveal a previously unreported 1.55% (95% credible interval:
  [0.62%, 2.52%]) entropy difference between obese and lean subjects that diminishes
  as exercise capacity increases. For individuals capable of completing at least 7.5
  minutes of testing, the 95% credible interval contained zero, suggesting potential
  insights into physiological complexity, exercise tolerance, and obesity. Our estimator
  refines biomedical signal PermEn estimation and underscores entropyâ€™s potential
  value as a health biomarker, opening avenues for further physiological and biomedical
  exploration.'
