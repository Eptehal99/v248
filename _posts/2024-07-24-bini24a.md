title: 'FlowCyt: A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Approaches for Multi-Class Classification
  in Flow Cytometry Benchmarking'
abstract: 'This paper presents FlowCyt, the first comprehensive benchmark for multi-class
  single-cell classification in flow cytometry data. The dataset comprises bone marrow
  samples from 30 patients, with each cell characterized by twelve markers. Ground
  truth labels identify five hematological cell types: T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes,
  Monocytes, Mast cells, and Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells (HSPCs). Experiments
  utilize supervised inductive learning and semi-supervised transductive learning
  on up to 1 million cells per patient. Baseline methods include Gaussian Mixture
  Models, XGBoost, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, and Graph Neural Networks
  (GNNs). GNNs demonstrate superior performance by exploiting spatial relationships
  in graph-encoded data. The benchmark allows standardized evaluation of clinically
  relevant classification tasks, along with exploratory analyses to gain insights
  into hematological cell phenotypes. This represents the first public flow cytometry
  benchmark with a richly annotated, heterogeneous dataset. It will empower the development
  and rigorous assessment of novel methodologies for single-cell analysis.'
