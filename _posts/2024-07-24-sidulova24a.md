title: Contextual Unsupervised Deep Clustering in Digital Pathology
abstract: Clustering can be used in medical imaging research to identify different
  domains within a specific dataset, aiding in a better understanding of subgroups
  or strata that may not have been annotated. Moreover, in digital pathology, clustering
  can be used to effectively sample image patches from whole slide images (WSI). In
  this work, we conduct a comparative analysis of three deep clustering algorithms
  – a simple two-step approach applying K-means onto a learned feature space, an end-to-end
  deep clustering method (DEC), and a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based method
  – in application to a digital pathology dataset of endometrial biopsy WSIs. For
  consistency, all methods use the same Autoencoder (AE) architecture backbone that
  extracts features from image patches. The GCN-based model, specifically, stands
  out as a deep clustering algorithm that considers spatial contextual information
  in predicting clusters. Our study highlights the computation of graphs for WSIs
  and emphasizes the impact of these graphs on the formation of clusters. The main
  finding of our research indicates that GCN-based deep clustering demonstrates heightened
  spatial awareness compared to the other methods, resulting in higher cluster agreement
  with previous clinical annotations of WSIs.
