title: 'Daily Physical Activity Monitoring: Adaptive Learning from Multi-source Motion
  Sensor Data'
abstract: In healthcare applications, there is a growing need to develop machine learning
  models that use data from a single source, such as that from a wrist wearable device,
  to monitor physical activities, assess health risks, and provide immediate health
  recommendations or interventions. However, the limitation of using single-source
  data often compromises the modelâ€™s accuracy, as it fails to capture the full scope
  of human activities. While a more comprehensive dataset can be gathered in a lab
  setting using multiple sensors attached to various body parts, this approach is
  not practical for everyday use due to the impracticality of wearing multiple sensors.
  To address this challenge, we introduce a transfer learning framework that optimizes
  machine learning models for everyday applications by leveraging multi-source data
  collected in a laboratory setting. We introduce a novel metric to leverage the inherent
  relationship between these multiple data sources, as they are all paired to capture
  aspects of the same physical activity. Through numerical experiments, our framework
  outperforms existing methods in classification accuracy and robustness to noise,
  offering a promising avenue for the enhancement of daily activity monitoring.
