title: 'FAMEWS: a Fairness Auditing tool for Medical Early-Warning Systems'
abstract: Machine learning applications hold promise to aid clinicians in a wide range
  of clinical tasks, from diagnosis to prognosis, treatment, and patient monitoring.
  These potential applications are accompanied by a surge of ethical concerns surrounding
  the use of Machine Learning (ML) models in healthcare, especially regarding fairness
  and non-discrimination. While there is an increasing number of regulatory policies
  to ensure the ethical and safe integration of such systems, the translation from
  policies to practices remains an open challenge. Algorithmic frameworks, aiming
  to bridge this gap, should be tailored to the application to enable the translation
  from fundamental human-right principles into accurate statistical analysis, capturing
  the inherent complexity and risks associated with the system.  In this work, we
  propose a set of fairness impartial checks especially adapted to ML early-warning
  systems in the medical context, comprising on top of standard fairness metrics,
  an analysis of clinical outcomes, and a screening of potential sources of bias in
  the pipeline. Our analysis is further fortified by the inclusion of event-based
  and prevalence-corrected metrics, as well as statistical tests to measure biases.
  Additionally, we emphasize the importance of considering subgroups beyond the conventional
  demographic attributes. Finally, to facilitate operationalization, we present an
  open-source tool FAMEWS to generate comprehensive fairness reports. These reports
  address the diverse needs and interests of the stakeholders involved in integrating
  ML into medical practice. The use of FAMEWS has the potential to reveal critical
  insights that might otherwise remain obscured. This can lead to improved model design,
  which in turn may translate into enhanced health outcomes.
