title: 'Algorithmic Changes Are Not Enough: Evaluating the Removal of Race Adjustment
  From the eGFR Equation'
abstract: 'Changing clinical algorithms to remove race adjustment has been proposed
  and implemented for multiple health conditions. Removing race adjustment from estimated
  glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) equations may reduce disparities in chronic kidney
  disease (CKD), but has not been studied in clinical practice after implementation.
  Here, we assessed whether implementing an eGFR equation (CKD-EPI 2021) without adjustment
  for Black or African American race modified quarterly rates of nephrology referrals
  and visits within a single healthcare system, Stanford Health Care (SHC). Our cohort
  study analyzed 547,194 adult patients aged 21 and older who had at least one recorded
  serum creatinine or serum cystatin C between January 1, 2019 and September 1, 2023.  During
  the study period, implementation of CKD-EPI 2021 did not modify rates of quarterly
  nephrology referrals in those documented as Black or African American or in the
  overall cohort. After adjusting for capacity at SHC nephrology clinics, estimated
  rates of nephrology referrals and visits with CKD-EPI 2021 were 34 (95% CI 29, 39)
  and 188 (175, 201) per 10,000 patients documented as Black or African American.
  If race adjustment had not been removed, estimated rates were nearly identical:
  38 (95% CI: 28, 53) and 189 (165, 218) per 10,000 patients. Changes to the eGFR
  equation are likely insufficient to achieve health equity in CKD care decision-making
  as many other structural inequities remain.'
