title: 'Regulating AI Adaptation: An Analysis of AI Medical Device Updates'
abstract: While the pace of development of AI has rapidly progressed in recent years,
  the implementation of safe and effective regulatory frameworks has lagged behind.
  In particular, the adaptive nature of AI models presents unique challenges to regulators
  as updating a model can improve its performance but also introduce safety risks.
  In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been a forerunner in regulating
  and approving hundreds of AI medical devices. To better understand how AI is updated
  and its regulatory considerations, we systematically analyze the frequency and nature
  of updates in FDA-approved AI medical devices. We find that less than 2% of all
  devices report having been updated by being re-trained on new data. Meanwhile, nearly
  a quarter of devices report updates in the form of new functionality and marketing
  claims. As an illustrative case study, we analyze pneumothorax detection models
  and find that while model performance can degrade by as much as 0.18 AUC when evaluated
  on new sites, re-training on site-specific data can mitigate this performance drop,
  recovering up to 0.23 AUC. However, we also observed significant degradation on
  the original site after re-training using data from new sites, providing insight
  from one example that challenges the current one-model-fits-all approach to regulatory
  approvals. Our analysis provides an in-depth look at the current state of FDA-approved
  AI device updates and insights for future regulatory policies toward model updating
  and adaptive AI.
