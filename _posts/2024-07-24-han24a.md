title: Interpretation of Intracardiac Electrograms Through Textual Representations
abstract: Understanding the irregular electrical activity of atrial fibrillation (AFib)
  has been a key challenge in electrocardiography. For serious cases of AFib, catheter
  ablations are performed to collect intracardiac electrograms (EGMs). EGMs offer
  intricately detailed and localized electrical activity of the heart and are an ideal
  modality for interpretable cardiac studies.  Recent advancements in artificial intelligence
  (AI) has allowed some works to utilize deep learning frameworks to interpret EGMs
  during AFib. Additionally, language models (LMs) have shown exceptional performance
  in being able to generalize to unseen domains, especially in healthcare. In this
  study, we are the first to leverage pretrained LMs for finetuning of EGM interpolation
  and AFib classification via masked language modeling. We formulate the EGM as a
  textual sequence and present competitive performances on AFib classification compared
  against other representations. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive interpretability
  study to provide a multi-perspective intuition of the modelâ€™s behavior, which could
  greatly benefit the clinical use.
