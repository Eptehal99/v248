title: Regularizing and Interpreting Vision Transformer by Patch Selection on Echocardiography
  Data
abstract: 'This work introduces a novel approach to model regularization and explanation
  in \Glspl{vit}, particularly beneficial for small-scale but high-dimensional data
  regimes, such as in healthcare. We introduce stochastic embedded feature selection
  in the context of echocardiography video analysis, specifically focusing on the
  EchoNet-Dynamic dataset for the prediction of \gls{lvef}. Our proposed method, termed
  \Glspl{gvit}, augments \Glspl{vvit}, a performant transformer architecture for videos
  with \Glspl{cae}, a common dataset-level feature selection technique, to enhance
  \gls{vvit}â€™s generalization and interpretability. The key contribution lies in the
  incorporation of stochastic token selection individually for each video frame during
  training. Such token selection regularizes the training of \gls{vvit}, improves
  its interpretability, and is achieved by differentiable sampling of categoricals
  using the Gumbel-Softmax distribution. Our experiments on EchoNet-Dynamic demonstrate
  a consistent and notable regularization effect. The \gls{gvit} model outperforms
  both a random selection baseline and standard \gls{vvit}. % using multiple evaluation
  metrics. The \gls{gvit} is also compared against recent works on EchoNet-Dynamic
  where it exhibits state-of-the-art performance among end-to-end learned methods.
  Finally, we explore model explainability by visualizing selected patches, providing
  insights into how the \gls{gvit} utilizes regions known to be crucial for \gls{lvef}
  prediction for humans. This proposed approach, therefore, extends beyond regularization,
  offering enhanced interpretability for \gls{vit}s. '
