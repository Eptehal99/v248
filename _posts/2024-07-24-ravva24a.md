title: A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Upper Limb Motion Intentions with
  Multimodal Data
abstract: Over the last decade, there has been significant progress in the field of
  interactive virtual rehabilitation. Physical therapy (PT) stands as a highly effective
  approach for enhancing physical impairments. However, patient motivation and progress
  tracking in rehabilitation outcomes remain a challenge. This work addresses the
  gap through a machine learning-based approach to objectively measure outcomes of
  the upper limb virtual therapy system in a user study with non-clinical participants.
  In this study, we use virtual reality to perform several tracing tasks while collecting
  motion and movement data using a KinArm robot and a custom-made wearable sleeve
  sensor. We introduce a two-step machine learning architecture to predict the motion
  intention of participants. The first step predicts \textbf{reaching task segments}
  to which the participant-marked points belonged using gaze, while the second step
  employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict \textbf{directional movements}
  based on resistance change values from the wearable sensor and the KinArm. We specifically
  propose to transpose our raw resistance data to the time-domain which significantly
  improves the accuracy of the models by 34.6%. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
  model, we compared different classification techniques with various data configurations.
  The results show that our proposed computational method is exceptional at predicting
  participantâ€™s actions with accuracy values of 96.72% for diamond reaching task,
  and 97.44% for circle reaching task, which demonstrates the great promise of using
  multimodal data, including eye-tracking and resistance change, to objectively measure
  the performance and intention in virtual rehabilitation settings.
