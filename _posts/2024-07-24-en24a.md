title: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation with Dynamic
  Prototype-based Contrastive Learning
abstract: Medical image segmentation typically requires numerous dense annotations
  in the target domain to train models, which is time-consuming and labour-intensive.
  To alleviate this challenge, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has emerged to
  enhance model generalization in the target domain by harnessing labeled data from
  the source domain along with unlabeled data from the target domain. In this paper,
  we introduce a novel Dynamic Prototype Contrastive Learning (DPCL) framework for
  UDA on medical image segmentation, which dynamically updates cross-domain global
  prototypes and excavates implicit discrepancy information in a contrastive manner.
  DPCL learns cross-domain global feature representations while enhancing the discriminative
  capability of the segmentation model. Specifically, we design a novel cross-domain
  prototype evolution module that generates evolved cross-domain prototypes by employing
  dynamic updating and evolutionary strategies. This module facilitates a gradual
  transition from the source to the target domain while acquiring cross-domain global
  guidance knowledge. Moreover, we devise a cross-domain embedding contrastive module
  that establishes contrastive relationships within the embedding space.  This module
  captures both homogeneous and heterogeneous information within the same category
  and among different categories, thereby enhancing the discriminative capability
  of the segmentation model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DPCL
  is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
