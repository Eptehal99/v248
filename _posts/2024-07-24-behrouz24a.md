title: 'Brain-Mamba: Encoding Brain Activity via Selective State Space Models'
abstract: 'Representation learning of brain activity is a key step toward unleashing
  machine learning models for use in the diagnosis of neurological diseases/disorders.
  Diagnosis of different neurological diseases/disorders, however, might require paying
  more attention to either spatial or temporal resolutions of brain activity. Accordingly,
  a generalized brain activity learner requires the ability of learning from both
  resolutions. Most existing studies, however, use domain knowledge to design brain
  encoders, and so are limited to a single neuroimage modality (e.g., EEG or fMRI)
  and its single resolution. Furthermore, their architecture design either: (1) uses
  self-attention mechanism with quadratic time with respect to input size, making
  its scalability limited, (2) is \emph{purely} based on message-passing graph neural
  networks, missing long-range dependencies and temporal resolution, and/or (3) encode
  brain activity in each unit of brain (e.g., voxel) separately, missing the dependencies
  of brain regions. In this study, we present BrainMamba, an attention free, scalable,
  and powerful framework to learn brain activity multivariate timeseries. BrainMamba
  uses two modules: (i) A novel multivariate timeseries encoder that leverage an MLP
  to fuse information across variates and an Selective Structured State Space (S4)
  architecture to encode each timeseries. (ii) A novel graph learning framework that
  leverage message-passing neural networks along with S4 architecture to selectively
  choose important brain regions. Our experiments on 7 real-world datasets with 3
  modalities show that BrainMamba attains outstanding performance and outperforms
  all baselines in different downstream tasks.'
