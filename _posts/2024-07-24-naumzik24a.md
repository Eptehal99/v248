title: 'Data-driven Subgrouping of Patient Trajectories with Chronic Diseases: Evidence
  from Low Back Pain'
abstract: 'Clinical data informs the personalization of health care with a potential
  for more effective disease management. In practice, this is achieved by \emph{subgrouping},
  whereby clusters with similar patient characteristics are identified and then receive
  customized treatment plans with the goal of targeting subgroup-specific disease
  dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel mixture hidden Markov model for subgrouping
  patient trajectories from \emph{chronic diseases}. Our model is probabilistic and
  carefully designed to capture different trajectory phases of chronic diseases (i.e.,
  “severe”, “moderate”, and “mild”) through tailored latent states. We demonstrate
  our subgrouping framework based on a longitudinal study across 847 patients with
  non-specific low back pain. Here, our subgrouping framework identifies 8 subgroups.
  Further, we show that our subgrouping framework outperforms common baselines in
  terms of cluster validity indices. Finally, we discuss the applicability of the
  model to other chronic and long-lasting diseases. '
