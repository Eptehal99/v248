title: Temporally Multi-Scale Sparse Self-Attention for Physical Activity Data Imputation
abstract: Wearable sensors enable health researchers to continuously collect data
  pertaining to the physiological state of individuals in real-world settings. However,
  such data can be subject to extensive missingness due to a complex combination of
  factors. In this work, we study the problem of imputation of missing step count
  data, one of the most ubiquitous forms of wearable sensor data. We construct a novel
  and large scale data set consisting of a training set with over 3 million hourly
  step count observations and a test set with over 2.5 million hourly step count observations.
  We propose a domain knowledge-informed sparse self-attention model for this task
  that captures the temporal multi-scale nature of step-count data. We assess the
  performance of the model relative to baselines and conduct ablation studies to verify
  our specific model designs.
