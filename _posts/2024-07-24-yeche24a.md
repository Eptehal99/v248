title: Dynamic Survival Analysis for Early Event Prediction
abstract: This study advances Early Event Prediction (EEP) in healthcare through Dynamic
  Survival Analysis (DSA), offering a novel approach by integrating risk localization
  into alarm policies to enhance clinical event metrics. By adapting and evaluating
  DSA models against traditional EEP benchmarks, our research demonstrates their ability
  to match EEP models on a time-step level and significantly improve event-level metrics
  through a new alarm prioritization scheme (up to 11% AuPRC difference). This approach
  represents a significant step forward in predictive healthcare, providing a more
  nuanced and actionable framework for early event prediction and management.
