title: Using Expert Gaze for Self-Supervised and Supervised Contrastive Learning of
  Glaucoma from OCT Data
abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of limited data availability common
  in healthcare settings by using clinician (ophthalmologist) gaze data on optical
  coherence tomography (OCT) report images as they diagnose glaucoma, a top cause
  of irreversible blindness worldwide. We directly learn gaze representations with
  our ‘GazeFormerMD’ model to generate pseudo-labels using a novel multi-task objective,
  combining triplet and cross-entropy losses. We use these pseudo-labels for weakly
  supervised contrastive learning (WSupCon) to detect glaucoma from a partially-labeled
  dataset of OCT report images. Our natural-language-inspired region-based-encoding
  GazeFormerMD model pseudo-labels, trained using our multi-task objective, enable
  downstream glaucoma detection accuracy via WSupCon exceeding 91% even with only
  70% labeled training data. Furthermore, a model pre-trained with GazeFormerMD-generated
  pseudo-labels and used for linear evaluation on an unseen OCT-report dataset achieved
  comparable performance to a fully-supervised, trained-from-scratch model while using
  only 25% labeled data.
