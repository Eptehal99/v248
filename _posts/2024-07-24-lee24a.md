title: Vision-Language Generative Model for View-Specific Chest X-ray Generation
abstract: Synthetic medical data generation has opened up new possibilities in the
  healthcare domain, offering a powerful tool for simulating clinical scenarios, enhancing
  diagnostic and treatment quality, gaining granular medical knowledge, and accelerating
  the development of unbiased algorithms. In this context, we present a novel approach
  called ViewXGen, designed to overcome the limitations of existing methods that rely
  on general domain pipelines using only radiology reports to generate frontal-view
  chest X-rays. Our approach takes into consideration the diverse view positions found
  in the dataset, enabling the generation of chest X-rays with specific views, which
  marks a significant advancement in the field. To achieve this, we introduce a set
  of specially designed tokens for each view position, tailoring the generation process
  to the userâ€™s preferences. Furthermore, we leverage multi-view chest X-rays as input,
  incorporating valuable information from different views within the same study. This
  integration rectifies potential errors and contributes to faithfully capturing abnormal
  findings in chest X-ray generation. To validate the effectiveness of our approach,
  we conducted statistical analyses, evaluating its performance in a clinical efficacy
  metric on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. Also, human evaluation demonstrates the remarkable
  capabilities of ViewXGen, particularly in producing realistic view-specific X-rays
  that closely resemble the original images.
