title: 'Tuning In: Comparative Analysis of Audio Classifier Performance in Clinical
  Settings with Limited Data'
abstract: This study assesses deep learning models for audio classification in a clinical
  setting with the constraint of small datasets reflecting the prospective collection
  of real-world data. We analyze CNNs, including DenseNet and ConvNeXt, alongside
  transformer models like ViT, and SWIN, and compare them against pretrained audio
  models such as AST, YAMNet and VGGish. Our method highlights the benefits of pretraining
  on large datasets before fine-tuning on specific clinical data. We prospectively
  collected two first-of-its-kind patient audio datasets from stroke patients. We
  investigated various preprocessing techniques, finding that RGB and grayscale spectrogram
  transformations affect model performance differently based on the priors they learn
  from pretraining. Our findings indicate CNNs can match or exceed transformer models
  in small dataset contexts, with DenseNet-Contrastive and AST models showing notable
  performance. This study highlights the significance of incremental marginal gains
  through model selection, pretraining, and preprocessing in sound classification;
  this offers valuable insights for clinical diagnostics that rely on audio classification.
