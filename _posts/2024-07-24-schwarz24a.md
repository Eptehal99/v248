title: 'DDoS: A Graph neural Network Based Drug Synergy Prediction Algorithm'
abstract: Drug synergy arises when the combined impact of two drugs exceeds the sum
  of their individual effects. While single-drug effects on cell lines are well-documented,
  the scarcity of data on drug synergy, considering the vast array of potential drug
  combinations, prompts a growing interest in computational approaches for predicting
  synergies in untested drug pairs. We introduce a Graph Neural Network (\textit{GNN})
  based model for drug synergy prediction, which utilizes drug chemical structures
  and cell line gene expression data. We extract data from the largest available drug
  combination database (DrugComb) and generate multiple synergy scores (commonly used
  in the literature) to create seven datasets that serve as a reliable benchmark with
  high confidence. In contrast to conventional models relying on pre-computed chemical
  features, our GNN-based approach learns task-specific drug representations directly
  from the graph structure of the drugs, providing superior performance in predicting
  drug synergies. Our work suggests that learning task-specific drug representations
  and leveraging a diverse dataset is a promising approach to advancing our understanding
  of drug-drug interaction and synergy.
