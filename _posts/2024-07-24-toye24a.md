title: Simulation of Health Time Series with Nonstationarity
abstract: Limited access to health data remains a challenge for developing machine
  learning (ML) models. Health data is difficult to share due to privacy concerns
  and often does not have ground truth. Simulated data is often used for evaluating
  algorithms, as it can be shared freely and generated with ground truth. However,
  for simulated data to be used as an alternative to real data, algorithmic performance
  must be similar to that of real data. Existing simulation approaches are either
  black boxes or rely solely on expert knowledge, which may be incomplete. These methods
  generate data that often overstates performance, as they do not simulate many of
  the properties that make real data challenging. Nonstationarity, where a systemâ€™s
  properties or parameters change over time, is pervasive in health data with changing
  health status of patients, standards of care, and populations. This makes ML challenging
  and can lead to reduced model generalizability, yet there have not been ways to
  systematically simulate realistic nonstationary data. This paper introduces a modular
  approach for learning dataset-specific models of nonstationarity in real data and
  augmenting simulated data with these properties to generate realistic synthetic
  datasets. We show that our simulation approach brings performance closer to that
  of real data in stress classification and glucose forecasting in people with diabetes.
