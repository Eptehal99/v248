title: Explainable and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning via Domain-Aware Symbolic
  Regression
abstract: 'Explainability and privacy are the top concerns in machine learning (ML)
  for medical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Domain-Aware
  Symbolic Regression with Homomorphic Encryption (DASR-HE), that addresses both concerns
  simultaneously by: (i) producing domain-aware, intuitive and explainable models
  that do not require the end-user to possess ML expertise and (ii) training only
  on securely encrypted data without access to actual data values or model parameters.
  DASR-HE is based on Symbolic Regression (SR), which is a first-class ML approach
  that produces simple and concise equations for regression, requiring no ML expertise
  to interpret. In our work, we improve the performance of SR algorithms by using
  existing domain-specific medical equations to augment the search space of equations,
  decreasing the search complexity and producing equations that are similar in structure
  to those used in practice. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, we enable
  our algorithm to learn on data that is homomorphically encrypted (HE), meaning that
  arithmetic operations can be done in the encrypted space. This makes HE suitable
  for machine learning algorithms to learn models without access to the actual data
  values or model parameters. We evaluate DASR-HE on three medical tasks, namely predicting
  glomerular filtration rate, endotracheal tube (ETT) internal diameter and ETT depth
  and find that DASR-HE outperforms existing medical equations, other SR ML algorithms
  and other explainable ML algorithms. '
