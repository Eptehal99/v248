title: 'Enhancing Collaborative Medical Outcomes through Private Synthetic Hypercube
  Augmentation: PriSHA'
abstract: Data sharing across multiple health systems has the significant challenge
  of maintaining data privacy. Access to detailed, high-quality data is important
  for machine learning models trained to predict clinically relevant outcomes to generalize
  across different patient populations. However, health systems often are limited
  to patient data within their networks, which may not adequately represent the breadth
  of patient populations. This limitation is especially pronounced in the case of
  patients with rare or unique characteristics, resulting in decreased accuracy for
  this minority group. To address these challenges, our work introduces a framework
  designed to enhance existing clinical models, Private Synthetic Hypercube Augmentation
  (PriSHA). We use generative models to produce synthetic data as a means to augment
  these models while adhering to strict privacy standards. This approach has the potential
  to improve model performance without compromising patient confidentiality. To our
  knowledge, our framework is the first synthetic data augmentation framework that
  merges privacy-preserving tabular data and real data from multiple sources.
