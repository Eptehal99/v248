title: 'FETCH: A Fast and Efficient Technique for Channel Selection in EEG Wearable
  Systems'
abstract: The rapid development of wearable biomedical systems now enables real-time
  monitoring of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Acquisition of these signals
  relies on electrodes. These systems must meet the design challenge of selecting
  an optimal set of electrodes that balances performance and usability constraints.  The
  search for the optimal subset of electrodes from a larger set is a problem with
  combinatorial complexity. While existing research has primarily focused on search
  strategies that only explore limited combinations, our methodology proposes a computationally
  efficient way to explore all combinations. To avoid the computational burden associated
  with training the model for each combination, we leverage an innovative approach
  inspired by few-shot learning. Remarkably, this strategy covers all the wearable
  electrode combinations while significantly reducing training time compared to retraining
  the network on each possible combination. In the context of an epileptic seizure
  detection task, the proposed method achieves an AUC value of 0.917 with configurations
  using eight electrodes. This performance matches that of prior research but is achieved
  in significantly less time, transforming a process that would span months into a
  matter of hours on a single GPU device. Our work allows comprehensive exploration
  of electrode configurations in wearable biomedical device design, yielding insights
  that enhance performance and real-world feasibility.
