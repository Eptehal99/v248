title: 'Retrieving Evidence from EHRs with LLMs: Possibilities and Challenges'
abstract: Unstructured data in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) often contains critical
  information—complementary to imaging—that could inform radiologists’ diagnoses.  But
  the large volume of notes often associated with patients together with time constraints
  renders manually identifying relevant evidence practically infeasible. In this work
  we propose and evaluate a zero-shot strategy for using LLMs as a mechanism to efficiently
  retrieve and summarize unstructured evidence in patient EHR relevant to a given
  query.   Our method entails tasking an LLM to infer whether a patient has, or is
  at risk of, a particular condition on the basis of associated notes; if so, we ask
  the model to summarize the supporting evidence.  Under expert evaluation, we find
  that this LLM-based approach provides outputs consistently preferred to a pre-LLM
  information retrieval baseline.  Manual evaluation is expensive, so we also propose
  and validate a method using an LLM to evaluate (other) LLM outputs for this task,
  allowing us to scale up evaluation. Our findings indicate the promise of LLMs as
  interfaces to EHR, but also highlight the outstanding challenge posed by “hallucinations”.
  In this setting, however, we show that model confidence in outputs strongly correlates
  with faithful summaries, offering a practical means to limit confabulations.
