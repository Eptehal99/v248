title: 'Integrating ChatGPT into Secure Hospital Networks: A Case Study on Improving
  Radiology Report Analysis'
abstract: This study demonstrates the first in-hospital adaptation of a cloud-based
  AI, similar to ChatGPT, into a secure model for analyzing radiology reports, prioritizing
  patient data privacy. By employing a unique sentence-level knowledge distillation
  method through contrastive learning, we achieve over 95% accuracy in detecting anomalies.
  The model also accurately flags uncertainties in its predictions, enhancing its
  reliability and interpretability for physicians with certainty indicators. Despite
  limitations in data privacy during the training phase, such as requiring de-identification
  or IRB permission, our study is significant in addressing this issue in the inference
  phase (once the local model is trained), without the need for human annotation throughout
  the entire process. These advancements represent a new direction for developing
  secure and efficient AI tools for healthcare with minimal supervision, paving the
  way for a promising future of in-hospital AI applications.
