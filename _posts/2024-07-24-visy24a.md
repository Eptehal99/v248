title: Systematic Evaluation of Self-Supervised Learning Approaches for Wearable-Based
  Fatigue Recognition
abstract: Fatigue is one of the most prevalent symptoms of chronic diseases, such
  as Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s. Recently researchers have explored
  unobtrusive and continuous ways of fatigue monitoring using mobile and wearable
  devices. However, data quality and limited labeled data availability in the wearable
  health domain pose significant challenges to progress in the field. In this work,
  we perform a systematic evaluation of self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks for fatigue
  recognition using wearable sensor data. To establish our benchmark, we use Homekit2020,
  which is a large-scale dataset collected using Fitbit devices in everyday life settings.
  Our results show that the majority of the SSL tasks outperform fully supervised
  baselines for fatigue recognition, even in limited labeled data scenarios. In particular,
  the domain features and multi-task learning achieve 0.7371 and 0.7323 AUROC, which
  are higher than the other SSL tasks and supervised learning baselines. In most of
  the pre-training tasks, the performance is higher when using at least one data augmentation
  that reflects the potentially low quality of wearable data (e.g., missing data).  Our
  findings open up promising opportunities for continuous assessment of fatigue in
  real settings and can be used to guide the design and development of health monitoring
  systems.
