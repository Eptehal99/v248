title: A cross-study Analysis of Wearable Datasets and the Generalizability of Acute
  Illness Monitoring Models
abstract: 'Large-scale wearable datasets are increasingly being used for biomedical
  research and to develop machine learning (ML) models for longitudinal health monitoring
  applications. However, it is largely unknown whether biases in these datasets lead
  to findings that do not generalize. Here, we present the first comparison of the
  data underlying multiple longitudinal, wearable-device-based datasets. We examine
  participant-level resting heart rate (HR) from four studies, each with thousands
  of wearable device users. We demonstrate that multiple regression, a community standard
  statistical approach, leads to conflicting conclusions about important demographic
  variables (age vs resting HR) and significant intra- and inter-dataset differences
  in HR. We then directly test the cross-dataset generalizability of a commonly used
  ML model trained for three existing day-level monitoring tasks: prediction of testing
  positive for a respiratory virus, flu symptoms, and fever symptoms. Regardless of
  task, most models showed relative performance loss on external datasets; most of
  this performance change can be attributed to concept shift between datasets. These
  findings suggest that research using large-scale, pre-existing wearable datasets
  might face bias and generalizability challenges similar to research in more established
  biomedical and ML disciplines. We hope that the findings from this study will encourage
  discussion in the wearable-ML community around standards that anticipate and account
  for challenges in dataset bias and model generalizability.'
