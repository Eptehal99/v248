title: 'DoseMate: A Real-world Evaluation of Machine Learning Classification of Pill
  Taking Using Wrist-worn Motion Sensors'
abstract: Non-adherence to medication is a complex behavioral issue that costs hundreds
  of billions of dollars annually in the United States alone. Existing solutions to
  improve medication adherence are limited in their effectiveness and require significant
  user involvement. To address this, a minimally invasive mobile health system called
  \myname{} is proposed, which can provide quantifiable adherence data and imposes
  minimal user burden. To classify a motion time-series that defines pill-taking,
  we adopt transfer-learning and data augmentation based techniques that uses captured
  pill-taking gestures along with other open datasets that represent negative labels
  of other wrist motions. The paper also provides a design methodology \updated{that
  generalizes to other} systems and describes a first-of-its-kind, in-the-wild, unobtrusively
  obtained dataset that contains unrestricted pill-related motion data from a diverse
  set of users.
