title: Development of Error Passing Network for Optimizing the Prediction of VO$_2$
  peak in Childhood Acute Leukemia Survivors
abstract: 'Approximately two-thirds of survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia (ALL) cancer develop late adverse effects post-treatment. Prior studies
  explored prediction models for personalized follow-up, but none integrated the usage
  of neural networks to date. In this work, we propose the Error Passing Network (EPN),
  a graph-based method that leverages relationships between samples to propagate residuals
  and adjust predictions of any machine learning model. We tested our approach to
  estimate patients’ \vo peak, a reliable indicator of their cardiac health. We used
  the EPN in conjunction with several baseline models and observed up to 12.16% improvement
  in the mean average percentage error compared to the last established equation predicting
  \vo peak in childhood ALL survivors. Along with this performance improvement, our
  final model is more efficient considering that it relies only on clinical variables
  that can be self-reported by patients, therefore removing the previous need of executing
  a resource-consuming physical test. '
