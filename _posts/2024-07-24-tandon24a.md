title: 's-SuStaIn: Scaling subtype and stage inference via simultaneous clustering
  of subjects and biomarkers'
abstract: Event-based models (EBM) provide an important platform for modeling disease
  progression. This work successfully extends previous EBM approaches to work with
  larger sets of biomarkers while simultaneously modeling heterogeneity in disease
  progression trajectories. We develop and validate the s-SuStain method for scalable
  event-based modeling of disease progression subtypes using large numbers of features.
  s-SuStaIn is typically an order of magnitude faster than its predecessor (SuStaIn).
  Moreover, we perform a case study with s-SuStaIn using open access cross-sectional
  Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging (ADNI) data to stage AD patients into four subtypes
  based on dynamic disease progression. s-SuStaIn shows that the inferred subtypes
  and stages predict progression to AD among MCI subjects. The subtypes show difference
  in AD incidence-rates and reveal clinically meaningful progression trajectories
  when mapped to a brain atlas.
