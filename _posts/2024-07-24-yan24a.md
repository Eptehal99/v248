title: 'SQUWA: Signal Quality Aware DNN Architecture for Enhanced Accuracy in Atrial
  Fibrillation Detection from Noisy PPG Signals'
abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, significantly increases
  the risk of stroke, heart disease, and mortality. Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers
  a promising solution for continuous AF monitoring, due to its cost efficiency and
  integration into wearable devices. Nonetheless, PPG signals are susceptible to corruption
  from motion artifacts and other factors often encountered in ambulatory settings.
  Conventional approaches typically discard corrupted segments or attempt to reconstruct
  original signals, allowing for the use of standard machine learning techniques.
  However, this reduces dataset size and introduces biases, compromising prediction
  accuracy and the effectiveness of continuous monitoring. We propose a novel deep
  learning model, \textbf{\underline{S}}ignal \textbf{\underline{Qu}}ality \textbf{\underline{W}}eighted
  Fusion of \textbf{\underline{A}}ttentional Convolution and Recurrent Neural Network
  (SQUWA), designed to learn how to retain accurate predictions from partially corrupted
  PPG. Specifically, SQUWA innovatively integrates an attention mechanism that directly
  considers signal quality during the learning process, dynamically adjusting the
  weights of time series segments based on their quality. This approach enhances the
  influence of higher-quality segments while reducing that of lower-quality ones,
  effectively utilizing partially corrupted segments. This approach represents a departure
  from the conventional methods that exclude such segments, enabling the utilization
  of a broader range of data, which has great implications for less disruption when
  monitoring of AF risks and more accurate estimation of AF burdens. Moreover, SQUWA
  utilizes variable-sized convolutional kernels to capture complex PPG signal patterns
  across different resolutions for enhanced learning. Our extensive experiments show
  that SQUWA outperform existing PPG-based models, achieving the highest AUCPR of
  0.89 with label noise mitigation. This also exceeds the 0.86 AUCPR of models trained
  with using both electrocardiogram (ECG) and PPG data.
