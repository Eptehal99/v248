title: Learning Social Fairness Preferences from Non-Expert Stakeholder Opinions in
  Kidney Placement
abstract: Modern kidney placement incorporates several intelligent recommendation
  systems which exhibit social discrimination due to biases inherited from training
  data. Although initial attempts were made in the literature to study algorithmic
  fairness in kidney placement, these methods replace true outcomes with surgeons’
  decisions due to the long delays involved in recording such outcomes reliably. However,
  the replacement of true outcomes with surgeons’ decisions disregards expert stakeholders’
  biases as well as social opinions of other stakeholders who do not possess medical
  expertise. This paper alleviates the latter concern and designs a novel fairness
  feedback survey to evaluate an acceptance rate predictor (ARP) that predicts a kidney’s
  acceptance rate in a given kidney-match pair. The survey is launched on Prolific,
  a crowdsourcing platform, and public opinions are collected from 85 anonymous crowd
  participants. A novel social fairness preference learning algorithm is proposed
  based on minimizing social feedback regret computed using a novel logit-based fairness
  feedback model. The proposed model and learning algorithm are both validated using
  simulation experiments as well as Prolific data. Public preferences towards group
  fairness notions in the context of kidney placement have been estimated and discussed
  in detail. The specific ARP tested in the Prolific survey has been deemed fair by
  the participants.
