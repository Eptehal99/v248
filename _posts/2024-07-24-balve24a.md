title: Interpretable breast cancer classification using CNNs on mammographic images
abstract: Deep learning models have achieved promising results in breast cancer classification,
  yet their ’black-box’ nature raises interpretability concerns. This research addresses
  the crucial need to gain insights into the decision-making process of convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs) for mammogram classification, specifically focusing on the
  underlying reasons for the CNN’s predictions of breast cancer. For CNNs trained
  on the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) dataset, we compared the post-hoc
  interpretability techniques LIME, Grad-CAM, and Kernel SHAP in terms of explanatory
  depth and computational efficiency. The results of this analysis indicate that Grad-CAM,
  in particular, provides comprehensive insights into the behavior of the CNN, revealing
  distinctive patterns in normal, benign, and malignant breast tissue. We discuss
  the implications of the current findings for the use of machine learning models
  and interpretation techniques in clinical practice.
